        <h1>15 SAT Math Tips and Strategies to Boost Your Score</h1>
        <div class="blog-meta">Updated February 2026 &middot; 8 min read &middot; <a href="../us/sat/">SAT Past Papers</a></div>

        <p>Whether you're aiming for a 700+ or just getting started, these 15 SAT math tips will help you approach the Digital SAT with confidence. These strategies work for both the calculator and no-calculator modules.</p>

        <h2>Before the Test: Preparation Tips</h2>

        <h3>1. Know the Format Inside Out</h3>
        <p>The Digital SAT Math section has two modules of 22 questions each, for a total of 44 questions in 70 minutes. Module 2 adapts based on your Module 1 performance. Understanding this structure helps you manage time and expectations.</p>

        <h3>2. Master the Core Topics</h3>
        <p>Four domains make up the SAT Math section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algebra</strong> (35%): Linear equations, systems, inequalities</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Math</strong> (35%): Quadratics, polynomials, exponentials</li>
            <li><strong>Problem Solving &amp; Data Analysis</strong> (15%): Ratios, percentages, statistics</li>
            <li><strong>Geometry &amp; Trigonometry</strong> (15%): Circles, triangles, trig functions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Algebra and Advanced Math together make up 70% of the test. If you're short on time, prioritize these two domains.
        </div>

        <h3>3. Practice With Real SAT Papers</h3>
        <p>Nothing beats practicing with actual released SAT exams. Official papers match the real test in difficulty and style. We host <a href="../us/sat/">40+ released SAT exams</a> as free PDF downloads, organized by year.</p>

        <h3>4. Learn the Desmos Calculator</h3>
        <p>The Digital SAT provides a built-in Desmos graphing calculator for both modules. Master these Desmos features before test day:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphing equations to find intersections visually</li>
            <li>Using tables to test values quickly</li>
            <li>Solving systems of equations by graphing both lines</li>
            <li>Finding zeros and vertices of parabolas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>During the Test: Strategy Tips</h2>

        <h3>5. Read Every Question Carefully</h3>
        <p>Many students lose points not from lack of math knowledge, but from misreading what the question asks. Watch out for "which is NOT" or "what is the value of 3x" (not just x).</p>

        <h3>6. Use the Process of Elimination</h3>
        <p>For multiple-choice questions, eliminate obviously wrong answers first. Even eliminating one option improves your odds significantly. Plug answer choices back into the equation when possible.</p>

        <h3>7. Back-Solve From Answer Choices</h3>
        <p>When a question asks "What value of x satisfies..." and gives four options, try plugging each answer choice into the equation. Start with the middle values to narrow down efficiently.</p>

        <h3>8. Don't Get Stuck</h3>
        <p>You have about 95 seconds per question. If a question takes more than 2 minutes, flag it and move on. The Digital SAT lets you flag questions and return to them within the same module.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Time Rule:</strong> Spend no more than 90 seconds on any single question in your first pass. Flag difficult questions and return to them after completing easier ones.
        </div>

        <h3>9. Check Units and Labels</h3>
        <p>Data analysis questions often include units (feet, meters, percentages). Make sure your answer matches the units asked for. A common trap is giving a decimal when the question asks for a percentage.</p>

        <h3>10. Use Estimation</h3>
        <p>For geometry and graph-reading questions, estimate the answer before calculating. If your calculation gives something wildly different from your estimate, you've likely made an error.</p>

        <h2>Must-Know Math Shortcuts</h2>

        <h3>11. Memorize Key Formulas</h3>
        <p>While the SAT provides a reference sheet, memorizing these formulas saves time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quadratic formula:</strong> x = (-b &plusmn; &radic;(b&sup2; - 4ac)) / 2a</li>
            <li><strong>Slope:</strong> m = (y&sub2; - y&sub1;) / (x&sub2; - x&sub1;)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance formula:</strong> d = &radic;((x&sub2;-x&sub1;)&sup2; + (y&sub2;-y&sub1;)&sup2;)</li>
            <li><strong>Circle equation:</strong> (x-h)&sup2; + (y-k)&sup2; = r&sup2;</li>
            <li><strong>Special right triangles:</strong> 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 ratios</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>12. Know Percent Change</h3>
        <p>Percent change = (New - Old) / Old &times; 100. This formula appears repeatedly in Problem Solving &amp; Data Analysis questions.</p>

        <h3>13. Understand Vertex Form</h3>
        <p>The vertex form y = a(x - h)&sup2; + k tells you the vertex is at (h, k). Converting from standard form to vertex form (completing the square) is a skill tested multiple times on every SAT.</p>

        <h2>Final Week Tips</h2>

        <h3>14. Take Timed Practice Tests</h3>
        <p>In the final week, take at least two full-length practice tests under timed conditions. Use our <a href="../us/sat/">free SAT practice tests</a> to simulate real exam conditions.</p>

        <h3>15. Review Your Mistakes</h3>
        <p>After each practice test, spend more time reviewing errors than taking new tests. Categorize mistakes as: careless errors, concept gaps, or time pressure. Focus your last few study days on concept gaps.</p>

# SVG Geometry Diagram Verification Rules

## MANDATORY: Run bkit:code-analyzer agent before any fix

## Verification Checklist (must pass before commit)

### 1. Angle Arc Direction (BUG-001)
- Arc sweep-flag must be OUTWARD from vertex (away from angle interior)
- Left vertices: sweep=0 | Right vertices: sweep=1
- Cross-product rule: cross2D(arm1, arm2) < 0 → sweep=0, > 0 → sweep=1

### 2. Vertex Label Overlap (BUG-003)
- **Rule:** Any two labels at same y-level (|y2-y1| < 5px) must have |x2-x1| ≥ 15px
- **Preferred:** ≥ 20px separation
- **Check:** When two triangles share an edge or are adjacent, check the inner pair of labels
- Common danger zone: rightmost label of triangle 1 vs leftmost label of triangle 2

### 3. Tick Mark Direction
- Tick marks must be PERPENDICULAR to the side they mark
- Direction (dy, dx) for side with direction (dx, dy) — NOT parallel to side

### 4. Duplicate Stroke Lines
- Never draw an explicit `<line>` for an edge that is already drawn by a `<polygon>`
- Check: if polygon covers segment AB, remove any `<line x1=Ax y1=Ay x2=Bx y2=By>`

### 5. CPCTC Text Placement
- CPCTC labels must appear OUTSIDE all triangle polygons
